JavaScript: Password Generator

##Project Description
This application generates a new password that is between 8 and 128 characters in length, composed of a random mix of numeric, uppercase, lowercase, and/or special characters. The user will get prompted to try again if they fail to enter a numeric value between 8 and 128.
The user is prompted to start the password generation process when they click on the "Generate Password" button displayed on the middle of the webpage.
The user will then select "Cancel" -- which is no -- or "OK" -- which is yes -- for whether or not the password should include numeric, uppercase, lowercase, and/or special characters.
Once the user has selected yes or no to all the prompts, a password will be displayed beneath the title "Generate a password" on the same webpage.
